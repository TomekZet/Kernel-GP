WARNING:
In function set f0 for the GPTreeConstraints tc0, no *nonterminals* are given with the return type c_coef which is required by other functions in the function set or by the tree's return type.  This may or may not be a problem for you.
PARAMETER: gp.tc.0
WARNING:
In function set f0 for the GPTreeConstraints tc0, no *nonterminals* are given with the return type c_degree which is required by other functions in the function set or by the tree's return type.  This may or may not be a problem for you.
PARAMETER: gp.tc.0
WARNING:
In function set f0 for the GPTreeConstraints tc0, no *nonterminals* are given with the return type c_gamma which is required by other functions in the function set or by the tree's return type.  This may or may not be a problem for you.
PARAMETER: gp.tc.0
WARNING:
In function set f0 for the GPTreeConstraints tc0, no *nonterminals* are given with the return type c_a which is required by other functions in the function set or by the tree's return type.  This may or may not be a problem for you.
